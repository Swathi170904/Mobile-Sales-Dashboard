<h3 style="font-family:'Times New Roman';"><u>1. Key Performance Metrics</u></h3>

<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; text-align:justify;">
The dashboard highlights total sales of $729M, aggregate quantity sold over twelve months, total transactions, and the average unit price. The analysis indicates that high revenue combined with average pricing reflects a high-volume, high-velocity market strategy, where small pricing adjustments significantly influence profit margins.
</p>

<h3 style="font-family:'Times New Roman';"><u>2. Regional Performance Insights</u></h3>

<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; text-align:justify;">
Delhi serves as the primary revenue hub, while Mumbai operates as a secondary market with comparatively lower volume. Strategic resource allocation toward high-performing regions such as Delhi ensures more effective capital deployment, optimized inventory management, and focused marketing execution.
</p>

<h3 style="font-family:'Times New Roman';"><u>3. Time-Based Sales Trends</u></h3>

<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; text-align:justify;">
Monthly analysis identifies long-term growth patterns, while daily drill-down insights reveal high-velocity sales periods such as weekends. These findings support proactive inventory planning, workforce optimization, and logistics readiness during peak demand cycles.
</p>

<h3 style="font-family:'Times New Roman';"><u>4. Brand & Model Performance</u></h3>

<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; text-align:justify;">
Motorola emerges as the top-performing brand, with the leading three models contributing the majority of revenue. Concentrating marketing initiatives and supply chain management on these high-impact products maximizes return on investment while maintaining operational efficiency.
</p>

<h3 style="font-family:'Times New Roman';"><u>5. Customer Experience & Payments</u></h3>

<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; text-align:justify;">
Customer ratings range from one to five stars, reflecting overall service quality, while payment analysis indicates UPI as the dominant digital method and cash as a secondary option. Strong adoption of digital payments enhances transaction efficiency, reduces friction, and improves customer satisfaction, particularly within urban markets.
</p>

<h3 style="font-family:'Times New Roman';"><u>6. Data Engineering & Governance</u></h3>

<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; text-align:justify;">
The dashboard implements custom sales metrics using advanced aggregation logic to handle missing values, reconstructs unified date columns from individual components, and applies normalization techniques to ensure consistent reporting. These practices establish the dashboard as a reliable single source of truth for executive-level decision-making.
</p>

<h3 style="font-family:'Times New Roman';"><u>7. Technical Requirements & Skills Applied</u></h3>

<p style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; text-align:justify;">
The project demonstrates expertise in data modeling, DAX-based metric creation, interactive visualization development using Streamlit with KPIs and slicers, and data engineering through Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. It reflects strong analytical thinking in transforming raw sales data into actionable business insights across revenue performance, regional distribution, product trends, and customer behavior.
