<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; text-decoration:underline;">📱 Mobile Sales Dashboard</span>

<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">The Mobile Sales Dashboard is an interactive analytics tool built with <strong>Python</strong> and <strong>Streamlit</strong> to provide actionable insights into mobile sales data. It enables users to monitor revenue trends, evaluate product performance, and understand customer behavior through an intuitive interface with filters for brand, model, region, and date.</span>

<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; text-decoration:underline;">🔹 Key Performance Metrics</span>

<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">The dashboard highlights total sales of $729M, aggregate quantity sold over twelve months, total transactions, and the average unit price. Analysis indicates that high revenue combined with average pricing reflects a high-volume, high-velocity market strategy, where small pricing adjustments significantly influence profit margins.</span>

<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; text-decoration:underline;">🌍 Regional Performance Insights</span>

<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Delhi serves as the primary revenue hub, while Mumbai is a secondary market with lower relative volume. Resource allocation towards high-performing regions such as Delhi ensures more effective capital deployment, inventory management, and marketing strategy, avoiding diluted impact from equal distribution across regions.</span>

<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; text-decoration:underline;">📅 Time-Based Sales Trends</span>

<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Monthly analysis identifies long-term growth patterns, while daily drill-down reveals high-velocity sales days, such as weekends. These insights support proactive inventory planning, staffing optimization, and logistics readiness during peak demand periods.</span>

<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; text-decoration:underline;">📈 Brand & Model Performance</span>

<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Motorola emerges as the top-performing brand, with the top three models contributing the majority of revenue. Focusing marketing and supply chain efforts on these key models maximizes ROI and reduces operational complexity, while long-tail models are managed efficiently to maintain inventory balance.</span>

<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; text-decoration:underline;">💳 Customer Experience & Payments</span>

<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">Customer ratings range from one to five stars, indicating overall service quality, while payment analysis shows UPI as the primary digital method and cash as secondary. Strong adoption of digital payments reduces transaction friction, improves conversion rates, and enhances overall customer experience, particularly in urban markets.</span>

<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; text-decoration:underline;">🛠 Data Engineering & Governance</span>

<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">The dashboard implements custom sales metrics using SUMX to handle missing total sales data, reconstructs unified date columns from day, month, and year fields, and normalizes data for consistent reporting. These practices ensure the dashboard functions as a reliable single source of truth for executive decision-making.</span>

<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman'; text-decoration:underline;">💻 Technical Skills Applied</span>

<span style="font-family:'Times New Roman';">The project demonstrates expertise in data modeling, creation of DAX measures for total sales and transaction counts, visualization design using Streamlit with KPIs, slicers, and map charts, as well as data engineering with Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly. It highlights analytical thinking in generating actionable business insights from sales, regional performance, product trends, and customer behavior.</span>
